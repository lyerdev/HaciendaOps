# HaciendaOps Field Guide (HFG)

The HaciendaOps Field Guide is a lightweight resource for field workers and new hires. It contains trusted information about plant species, animal traits, and tool usage.

## Why It Matters
- Improves field safety
- Reduces mistakes (e.g., using toxic plants or wrong tools)
- Supports e-learning and visual training

## Integration
Each entry includes a `kaizen_notes` section for observations or improvements from the field, which may be reviewed and approved over time.
